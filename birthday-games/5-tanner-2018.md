# The Jingo
At some point in my brother's life, he and his friends created what would become known as a "Jingo".

To this day, I'm not totally sure what it is or why it exists. What I do know is that hats were worn with a Jingo emblazoned upon it, drawings were created, and the Jingo became more than a simple doodle. It became a symbol. An icon reminding the rest of the world that there was something that this group created that no one but them could truly understand. It is through this lens that I created the Ski World/Red alert hybrid.

## The background for the game 
### Ski World

My family loves to ski, but this brother in particular is very talented at it (we're talking double backflips and such). In the late 90s there was a CD Rom titled "Warren Miller's Ski World" that had a simple game on it where you'd ski down a slope and try!  to avoid obstacles and go off jumps etc. I used this as inspiration for the first half of the game. 

### Red Alert

The second half of the game (starting at `1:18`) is replicating Red Alert 2, a RTS game that my brothers and I spent many Friday nights of our childhood yelling at each other over.
